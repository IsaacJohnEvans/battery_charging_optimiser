Models
-----
BuySell at a proportional rate until a maximum 
    Simple price based strategy optimisation - 4D space
    Gradient rate is good
    MinSell - start selling 
    MaxSell - sell at max
    MinBuy - start buying
    MaxBuy - buy at max
    Arima extension - moving previous mean
    

Tasks
-----
Ryan - variable at each time step and then iterating - third party optimiser
Elliot - Random buy sell hold
Ben - implement third party optimiser
Freddy - difference between 24 hour and half hour market variation and futures possibility of using it as a heuristic
Isaac - linear variation of charging on BuySellNearMean, add battery cost per year and price per cycle/lifetime estimator 

Ryan - Static problem - last few constraints and optimum 
Elliot - Random graphs, and obtain standard deviation etc, write some stuff
Ben - Improve daily method, write intro
Freddy - Report on market 3, 
Isaac - Search/ decision tree model

Report 
-----
Describe the problem
Describe global optimisation
Static problem - the future is known
Predictive power - unknown future
Random and buysell linear - that don't need to see the future
Decision tree ???
Genetic algorithm ???
Worst constraints 
Conclusion -

To do for future prediction rolling mean 
-----
Rolling buy sell mean and linear dependency ARIMA 
Investigation of best combined market 

TO DO
-----
Bare bones class vs plotable class
Internal variable that stores the average price bought and average price sold for current electricity stored
Calculating rate that we need to buy and sell at based on lifetime vs uptime
Iterating over the dataset
Decision tree at each time 
Reinforcement learning
Considering the optimal decision over the next few hours
Stochastic optimisation methods - scipy and stuff 
Simulated annealing
Genetic or evolutionary algorithm 
Variance of market 
General trend of market 
Looking at general trends - general derivatives
Estimate constraints of linear programming problem
Use conditional probability to elimate variables 
Write some of the report

Using moving window mean for buy/sell decision as well as creating optimal market from M1 and M2
